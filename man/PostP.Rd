\title{The posterior probability criterion function for Phase II single-arm design}
\usage{
PostP(x, n, a, b, p0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the number of responses among \eqn{n} patients treated by the experimental drug at a certain stage of the trial.}

\item{n}{the number of patients treated by the experimental drug at a certain stage of the trial.}

\item{a}{the hyperparameter (shape1) of the Beta prior for the experimental drug.}

\item{b}{the hyperparameter (shape2) of the Beta prior for the experimental drug.}

\item{p0}{the prespecified reseponse rate.}
}
\value{
\item{prob}{the posterior probability: \eqn{Pr(p > p_0  | X=x)}}
}
