\title{The stopping boundaries based on the posterior probability criterion}
\usage{
PostP.design(type, nmax, a, b, p0, delta, theta)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{type of boundaries: "efficacy" or "futility".}

\item{nmax}{the maximum number of patients treated by the experimental drug.}

\item{a}{the hyperparameter (shape1) of the Beta prior for the experimental drug.}

\item{b}{the hyperparameter (shape2) of the Beta prior for the experimental drug.}

\item{p0}{the pre-specified reseponse rate.}

\item{delta}{the minimally acceptable increment of the response rate for the experimental drug compared with the standard drug.}

\item{theta}{the cutoff probability: typically, \eqn{\theta = [0.9, 0.99]} for efficacy, \eqn{\theta = [0.01, 0.1]} for futility.}
}
\value{
\item{boundset}{the boundaries set; \eqn{U_n} or \eqn{L_n}}
}
\description{
The design function to sequentially monitor sample size and boundary based on Thall and Simon's criterion.
}
\examples{
## Using vague prior Unif(0,1)
PostP.design(type = "futility", nmax=100, a=1, b=1, p0=0.15, delta=0.15, theta=0.05)
PostP.design(type = "efficacy", nmax=100, a=1, b=1, p0=0.15, delta=0.15, theta=0.9)
## Or using Jeffery prior with Beta(0.5,0.5)
PostP.design(type = "futility", nmax=100, a=0.5, b=0.5, p0=0.15, delta=0.15, theta=0.05)
PostP.design(type = "efficacy", nmax=100, a=0.5, b=0.5, p0=0.15, delta=0.15, theta=0.9)
