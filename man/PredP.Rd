\title{The predictive probability criterion function for Phase II single-arm design}
\usage{
PredP(x, n, nmax, a, b, p0, theta_t)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the number of responses among \eqn{n} patients treated by the experimental drug at a certain stage of the trial.}

\item{n}{the number of patients treated by the experimental drug at a certain stage of the trial.}

\item{nmax}{the maximum number of patients treated by the experimental drug.}

\item{a}{the hyperparameter (shape1) of the Beta prior for the experimental drug.}

\item{b}{the hyperparameter (shape2) of the Beta prior for the experimental drug.}

\item{p0}{the the response rate for the standard drug.}

\item{theta_t}{the prespecified target probability; tipically, \eqn{\theta_T = [0.85, 0.95]}.}
}
\value{
\item{prob}{the predictive probability: \eqn{PP = \sum\limits_{y=0}^{n_{max}-n} Pr(Y=y | x) I(\Pr(p > p_0 | Y=y, x) \geq \theta_T) }}
}
\description{
Lee and Liu's criterion function for determining the
trial decision cutoffs based on the predictive probability.
